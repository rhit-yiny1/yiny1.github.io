    <p>My name is Andy Yin, I'm a student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I'm majoring in Computer Science at the moment.</p>
    <p>I was originally from China, I've living in the U.S for about 6 years now. I took a gap year from college last year so I'm still counted as a sophomore at this point. When I'm not busy learning the secret of computer science, I love playing guitar and videos games. If you have any interest in discussing topics regarding programming, gaming, and guitar with me, I'll be happy to do that. I would love to meet more people and talk. It's always good to know other people who share the same interests.</p>
